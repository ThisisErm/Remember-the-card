# Remember-the-card
Memory Card Game Project: The game consists of a 4x4 grid of clickable cards that reveal their content when clicked.
When two matching cards are clicked consecutively, that is considered a correct guess.
Consecutively clicking on two cards that do not match is considered an incorrect guess.
When all cards have been matched correctly, the player has won the game. 
If no cards are matched after five incorrect guesses, the player has lost the game.

## Getting Started
 
* Click <a href =https://thisiserm.github.io/Remember-the-card/ target='_blank'>here</a> to play.

* The game's objective is to match each card on the grid to its counterpart. Click on any card to reveal its content. Then click on the card you believe will be the same. Clicking on 2 cards counts as 1 attempt. If after 5 attempts you have not found a matching card, you lose the game. Match all 16 cards and you win. Good luck!
